Now comes the fun part; programming the AI to play against ðŸ¤–  

Minimax Algorithm: Implementing an AI opponent using Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for decision-making.  

Heuristic Evaluation: Designing an evaluation function to assess board positions and choose optimal moves.  

Difficulty Levels: Adjusting AI strength based on predefined levels.
